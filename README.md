Saccade analysis and measurement research application

A cross-platform application written for analysis of saccades from data recorded using SMI iView X eye tracking systems.

Uses a custom XML stimulus specification system embedded in the eye data at the time of recording, so currently not much use for anyone outside of the New Zealand Brain Research Institute EyeLab. It will, however, open any current iView raw text files.
