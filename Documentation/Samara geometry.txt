Details of the EyeLab screen geometry are given at:
http://dokuwiki/doku.php?id=eyelab:screen_geometry

The key physical screen dimensions are: 1574 mm wide × 877 mm high, distance from eye = 1649 mm.
The pixel dimensions are: 1280 wide × 720 high.



VARIABLES:

distance As double
    Eye-to-screen distance in mm

width As double
    Physical width of the display in mm

height As double
    Physical height of the display in mm

Protected horizMmPerPixel As double

Protected horizScreenPixelCentre As Integer

pixelHeight As integer
    Number of pixels vertically on the screen

pixelWidth As integer
    Number of pixels across the screen

Protected radToDeg As double = 57.29577951308
    mRadToDeg = 180/gPi

Protected vertMmPerPixel As double

Protected vertScreenPixelCentre As Integer



FUNCTIONS:

Sub setupValues()
  horizMmPerPixel = width/pixelWidth 
  vertMmPerPixel = height/pixelHeight
  horizScreenPixelCentre = pixelWidth/2
  vertScreenPixelCentre = pixelHeight/2
End Sub


Function convertPixelsToAngle(pixelPosn as double, horizontal as boolean = TRUE) As double
  // converts a location from pixels to degrees.
  // Needs to know if the location is a horizontal or vertical one.
  
    if horizontal then
    return atan((pixelPosn - horizScreenPixelCentre) * horizMmPerPixel / distance) * radToDeg
  else
    return atan((pixelPosn - vertScreenPixelCentre) * vertMmPerPixel / distance) * radToDeg * -1 // invert to take care of differing iView and Experimenter origins.
  end if
End Function


Function convertAngleToPixels(angle as double, horizontal as boolean = TRUE) As double
  // reverse calculates a location from degrees to pixels for 2D plotting.
  // Needs to know if the location is a horizontal or vertical one.
    
  if horizontal then
    return distance * tan(angle/radToDeg)/horizMmPerPixel + horizScreenPixelCentre
  else
    return vertScreenPixelCentre - distance * tan(angle/radToDeg)/vertMmPerPixel
  end if
End Function
